# CWE Vulnerability Assessment

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) lists categories for system weaknesses and vulnerabilities that is developed by the community. In this project, 40 C test cases are created for four of the vulnerabilities that are listed in the CWE: CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow, CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow, CWE-416 Use After Free, and CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference.

CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow: This vulnerability occurs when a buffer allocated on stack memory is overwritten by the program such that memory outside of the intended data structure is modified. Stack-based buffer overflows could cause the program to crash and modify memory to execute arbitrary code or corrupt data

CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow: This vulnerability occurs when a buffer allocated on heap memory is overwritten by the program such that memory outside of the intended data structure is modified. Like stack-based buffer overflows, heap-based buffer overflows could cause the program to crash and modify memory to execute arbitrary code or corrupt data

CWE-416 Use After Free: This vulnerability occurs when a program references memory that has already been freed, which could corrupt data to use unexpected values and crash the program. Pointers that point to freed memory should be set to NULL, then when referencing the memory pointed by the pointer, a NULL check should be performed to determine if has been freed or not

CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference: This vulnerability occurs when a pointer that has been set to NULL is dereferenced by the program, which typically causes the program to crash or exit. NULL checks should be used when dereferencing a pointer that could be NULL to mitigate this vulnerability

# C program test cases

The test cases that are written for this vulnerability assessment, which are contained in the folder test_cases, are small C programs that are mostly modified or inspired from the test cases contained in the Juliet Test Suite (Juliet Test Suite for C/C++ Version 1.3, avaliable at: https://samate.nist.gov/SRD/testsuite.php), demonstrative examples provided by CWE, and Stack Overflow questions that are related to software bugs. 

Within each test case, comments are provided to describe the program, the vulnerability contained within the program and its consequence, where the vulnerability is triggered, and the mitigation for the vulnerability in the context of the test case. Also, an assertion is included in each test case to guard the vulnerability to avoid triggering the bug and to ensure that the code is safe to execute.

# Test case questions

In the folder test_cases/test_case_questions, the several test cases are modified by removing the introductory comments to each test case that describe the program and vulnerability, changing the file name to make the type of vulnerability less obvious, and adding additional lines of code and assertions to further obfuscate the type of vulnerability.

With these modified test cases, multiple choice questions are designed, which are created to help students learn about the different software vulnerabilities and to assess their knowledge on identifying and mitigating them.

# LLVM bitcode files

The .bc files for each test case, which is contained in the folder test_cases_bc, is compiled using clang 12.0.0 on a GitHub hosted runner, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu (ubuntu-latest) with a 64-bit architecture.
