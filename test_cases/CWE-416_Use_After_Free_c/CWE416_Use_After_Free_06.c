/*
Program description: In this program, the struct p_charStruct, is used to store two character pointers, p_charStruct->charFirst and p_charStruct->charSecond. which have memory allocated to store 16 characters each. The memory locations that p_charStruct->charFirst and p_charStruct->charSecond points to are assigned as "abcd" and "efgh" respectively,, then they are printed out. Finally, p_charStruct is freed and p_charStruct->charFirst and p_charStruct->charSecond are also freed

Vulnerability and consequence: However, after printing out the character pointers, the memory location for the p_charStruct is freed before freeing p_charStruct->charFirst and p_charStruct->charSecond. Therefore, when attempting to free the pointers in p_charStruct, a use after free error occurs

The vulnerability triggers in the following lines:
free(p_charStruct->charFirst);

Mitigation: To make this program safe to run, ensure that the pointers contained in p_charStruct are freed before freeing p_charStruct itself
