/*
Program description: In this program, a string stored in inputString and an integer size (which is assigned a value from standard input using fgets()) is passed into the function f(). Within f(), size is used as the size of the memory block allocation for the character pointer, c_str, then inputString is copied to c_str using memcpy(), and c_str is freed

Vulnerability and consequence: However, if malloc() fails e.g. because size is negative or there is insufficient memory, c_str is set to NULL. Therefore, a NULL pointer dereference occurs when the inputString is copied to c_str using memcpy()

The vulnerability triggers in the following lines:
memcpy(c_str, input_str, size);

Mitigation: To make this program safe to run, ensure that c_str is not set to NULL after malloc() by performing a NULL check. Use an if statement to ensure that the value of size is a suitable memory block size for malloc()
