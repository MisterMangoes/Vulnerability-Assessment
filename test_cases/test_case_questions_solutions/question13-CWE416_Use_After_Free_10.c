/*
Program description: In this program, a linked list is created. node1 is the first node in the linked list, which contains a pointer to the next node, node2. All nodes are freed by using the function free_list(). In this function, a for loop is used to traverse the linked list until the pointer to the next node is NULL to deallocate the memory for each node

Vulnerability and consequence: However, in the for loop to deallocate the memory for each node, the node p is freed before p->next is executed, thus causing a use after free error

The vulnerability triggers in the following lines:
for (p = head; p != NULL; p = p->next) {
	free(p);
}

Mitigation: To make this program safe to run, store a reference to p->next in another pointer before freeing p e.g. for (p = head; p != NULL; p = q) { q = p->next; free(p); }
