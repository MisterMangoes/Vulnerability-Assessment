/*
Question: Which of the following is NOT correct?
a) There is no stack buffer overflow at line 7 because the copy of the data to the buffer does not overrun the capacity of the buffer
b) To catch this bug, the assertion checks that the number of characters read by fgets() is less than the buffer 
c) The code has a stack buffer overflow at line 9 because the number of characters read by fgets() exceeds the number of characters that could be stored by the buffer
d) There is a null pointer dereference at line 16 because givenPassword is NULL when it is dereferenced
