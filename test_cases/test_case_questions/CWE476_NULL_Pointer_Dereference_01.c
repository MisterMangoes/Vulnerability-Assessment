/*
Question: Which of the following is NOT correct?
a) To catch this bug, the assertion should check that twoIntsStructPointer is not null
b) The null pointer dereference is first triggered at the if statement in line 14 because both sides of the & operator is executed
c) There is no null pointer dereference at line 11
d) The null pointer dereference is first triggered at line 15 because twoIntsStructPointer is null
