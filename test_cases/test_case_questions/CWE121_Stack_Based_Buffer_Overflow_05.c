Question: Which of the following is correct?
a) A stack buffer overflow occurs in the for loop at line 9 because the index overruns the boundary of the buffer
b) A stack buffer overflow occurs in the for loop at line 9 because sizeof() is not used when allocating memory
c) A heap buffer overflow occurs in the for loop at line 9 because the index overruns the boundary of the buffer
d) A heap buffer overflow occurs in the for loop at line 9 because sizeof() is not used when allocating memory
