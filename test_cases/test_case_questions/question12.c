/*
Question: Which of the following is NOT correct?
a) To catch this bug, the assertion checks that the memory allocated for node is equal to or greater than the size of struct node
b) A heap buffer overflow occurs because sizeof() is used incorrectly when allocating memory at line 11
c) Assigning p->data at line 12 will always trigger the heap buffer overflow
d) Assigning root->left and root->right at line 18 and 19 will always trigger the heap buffer overflow
