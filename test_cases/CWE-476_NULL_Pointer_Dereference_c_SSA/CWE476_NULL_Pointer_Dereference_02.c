/*
Program description: In this program, data is allocated memory for 75 longs, which are all assigned as 2 using a for loop, then data is set to NULL. Then, within another while loop, the element at index 10 of data is assigned as 10 

Vulnerability and consequence: However, after data is set to NULL, the program assigns the element at index 10 of data as 10, which causes a NULL pointer dereference

The vulnerability triggers in the following lines:
data[10] = 10L;

Mitigation: To make this program safe to run, ensure that data is not set to NULL if there are more uses. Perform a NULL check to ensure that data is not NULL
